TestNG -> Cédric Beust -> Java
Next Generation
J unit & N unit
unit testing framework
execution framework

1. Include testNG dependency in pom.xml
2. Install TestNG plugin -> Help -> Eclipse Market place -> TestNG

Steps to convert Java test cases -> TestNG test cases
1. Replace main() with a normal java method.

@BeforeSuite -> Connection with Saucelabs/BS
@BeforeTest -> Start Report creation
@BeforeClass -> Connect JDBC for db connection
@BeforeMethod -> Browser setup, Load URL, Maximize and Timeout
			@Test1
@AfterMethod -> Close Browser
@BeforeMethod -> Browser setup, Load URL, Maximize and Timeout
			@Test2
@AfterMethod -> Close Browser
@AfterClass -> Disconnect JDBC for db connection
@AfterTest -> Stop and generate Report
@AfterSuite -> Disconnection with Saucelabs/BS


Create a class
with all testNG annotations
2 @Test
2@Beforemethods
With before method and without after method
