package
1. When you are creating a package, the name of the package
should be in lowercase.
2. When you use (.) you are allowed to create a sub package
package = folder which stores java code

Class
1. Class is a place where you can code.
2. Class Name should always starts with a Uppercase.

Car - Class

Data - Variable
Type of car - Seden, hatchback, SUV, MUV, MPV
Brand - Suzuki, Honda, VW, Benz, BMW

Tranmisssion: Automatic/manual

Actions - methods
turnOn / Off
open/close the doors
change gear
drive
park
reverse
horn

rooftop

Class - methods and variables

Datatype
Primitive datatypes - abcd
Non Primitive datatypes  - noun, pronoun, verb
String, Array


Data
1. variable name should start with a lowercase & maintain
camel case.
firstNumber
firstName
lastName
middleName

. -> ;
Whenever you are ending a statement ;


Classroom assignment
1. create a package week1.day1 in src/main/java
2. Create a class called Car
3. Try to create all the datatypes learned.
 
operators
1. Arithmetic
+ - * / %
2. Relational
< <= > >= == !=
3. Logical
&& - AND
|| - OR
! - NOT

++ -- - Increamental and decremental operators

access modifiers
Restriction to the access of the resources
Resources: class, method and variables
public -> Kathirvan's Door bell - Anyone in this project can access
private -> Mask -> can be accessed with in the class
package/default/no modifier -> Bike -> Any one inside the package can access
protected -> 

class -> public,package
methods -> public,private,package,protected
variables -> public,private,package,protected


methods
Contains the actions to perform
to avoid code duplication and reusablity
method name should start with a lowercase & maintain camel case

Syntax:
accessModifier returnType methodName(input args){
}
returntype can be anything ie primitive or non primitive types
void - nothing

return statement should be the last line of the method


Car -> Class
printCarname ->
getRegNumber -> 8888
getColor ->
isCarPuncture() ->

public add 3 int
private sub 2 int
package mul 3 float
div 2 int

main() -> Car
try to access all the methods

Create another class called MyCar
main() -> try to access all the methods

Create another class in another package
main() -> try to access all the methods


Object
Syntax:
ClassName objectName = new ClassName();

Global variable - When you declare a variable in the class level
Anyone inside the class can use the variable.
Anyone accessing the class can access the variable.

Local Variable - When you declare a variable in the method level
Usablity of the variable is only inside the method

Constructor
Constructor is a spl method
which has the method name as the class name
This method will not have any return type
The gateway to the class

Constructor will give you the reference of the class
new keyword creates a new memory to store the reference.


When there is no constructor available, Java will create a 
virtual constructor or default constructor.

without constructor you can not create an object for the class
so you can not access any of the classes in the project

Constructor is the only way to provide input for a class



Conditional statements
if(condition){
true block
} else{
false block
}

Arrays
Length - 5
	0 - Arun
	1 - Tamil
	2 - Chandru
	3 - Padma
	4 - Manon
