Week 3 - Java OOPS and Collections
1. OOPS
Object - Oriented Programming
1. Inheritance
2. Polymorphism
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation







1. Inheritance - extends
Grand Father - Individual Bunglow in Adayar Boat club

Father - 4BHK villa in the ocean view of Thiruvanmiyur

Dhinesh (Manual tester) - 3 BHK Nellankarai (Beach View)

How many properties does Dhinesh own?
3
It is a concept of sharing one class members with another class by a relationship

2 children - 1 -> 3BHK & 2 -> 4BHK

Types of Inheritance:
1. Simple or Single Inheritance
Father -> Dhinesh
Class A -> Class B
Parent/super -> Child/sub

2. Multilevel Inheritance
Grand Father -> Father -> Dhinesh -> D's Daughter
Class A -> Class B -> Class C -> Class D



3. Multiple Inheritance -> This is not supported by Java Classes

Monday Morning
Breakfast table
1 - Idlies (Wife)
2 - Idlies (Mother)


Class A extends Class B & Class C
Class B m1()
Class C m1()
A.m1();

Vehicle - applyBrake(), soundHorn()
Car - openSunroof(), turnOnAC()
BMW - autoPark()
Audi - hybridFuel()
Auto - handStarter()
Bajaj - electronicMeter()



^ + a -> selectAll
^ + i -> intendation
^ + shift + f -> alignment
^ + + -> Increase font size


final
class, methods & variables
class -> you can not extend that class
method -> you can not override
variable -> you can not reassign value that
final int a = 5;






static
variables, methods:
1. static are stored in stack memory.
2. static members are class level members
when you want to access the static members you do nt need an obj
Classname.methodName() ;
Classname.variableName;







this
replacement of object of a class in the non-static methods alone

super
java keyword that is used in inheritance, for accessing super class methods
during the overriden process.


2. Polymorphism
compile-time/static/ overloading
happens within the class
duplicates the same method name with different number of args
or different types of args

run-time/dynamic/ overriding
happens within the inherited classes
over riding the base class functionlity in the sub class without 
changing the method signature



LearnOverloading
add() - 2 Int, 3 Int, 2 float, 1 float and 1 Int
main() -> call all the methods and verify.

applyBrake() -> Vehicle -> normal brake
applyBrake() -> Audi -> ABS brake
main() -> call both the apply brakes and verify




Class A m1()
Class B m1() super -> A.m1()
Class C m1() super -> B.m1()




Abstraction
Plan -> Architect
Implement the plan

You will not be able to construct a house properly


1. Code duplication
2. accessablity
get, loadURL, launchURL


Interface - Plan


RBI - Interface
minimumBalance()
provideDebitCard()

HDFC implementation of RBI
provideCreditCard()


MyBankAccount main()
Call HDFC, RBI



Array -> Collection of data of same data type
Limitation: Size

Collections
Data Structures
1. List
2. Set
3. Map

1. List
List -> Interface
Implementation class
1. ArrayList ->
2. LinkedList

Properties:
1. Allows duplicate values
{Arun, Balaji, Chandru, Deena, Arun, Elango}

2. Maintains the insertion order

1. [23,54,67,55,66,42,27,89] - Odd numbers
2. ["Arun","Deepa","Maria","Deepa","Sharmila","Muthu","Chinrasu"]
Print only the names starts with 'M'
Hint: startswith("M")



Set -> interface
Implementation class:
1. HashSet - hashing algorithm - Random
2. TreeSet - Ordered Output - ASCII sorted
3. LinkedHashSet - Maintains the insertion order

Properties of Set:
1. Allows only Unique values
2. May / may not maintain the insertion order based on the implementation class
