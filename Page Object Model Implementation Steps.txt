Page Object Model Implementation Steps:
----------------------------------------
1. Create a Base Class (ProjectSpecificMethods) to  keep all the common methods and variables for project
		1. SalesForce - SalesforceMethods
		2. Service - ServiceNowMethods
	- Create the BaseClass under a package (eg: com.leaftaps.ui.base)	
2. Create java classes for each page that we navigate in the application under pages package(com.leaftaps.ui.pages)	
3. All the java classes related to pages should extends the BaseClass (ProjectSpecificMethods)
4. Create methods for all the actions / verifications in the respective pages java class
5. All the methods in the pages should have return based on the landing page
		- Same Page : return this
		- another page : return new HomePage()
6. Create java classes for each testcase 
7. All the testcases java class should extends BaseClass (ProjectSpecificMethods)
8. Create constructor in all the pages java class with driver as an argument
9. Assign the driver argument to the global variables
				this.driver = receivedDriver
10. Pass the driver in all the constructors in the testcase and pages
